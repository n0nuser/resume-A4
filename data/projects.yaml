    Final Degree Project for Computer Science Bachelor degree.
    A FastAPI based agent capable of command execution, deployed on hosts that require monitoring.
    The agent sends requests to a Django/Django REST Framework web app that manages data and presents it.
    The web app is deployed with Nginx and Uvicorn for the Web Server, Redis for the background tasks and PostgreSQL for the database. 
    Deployment of the web app is done with Docker.
